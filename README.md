# Titanic-I
Do you know Kaggle? Do you know their competitions? Do you know the Titanic competition? This is my first submission to get a perfect score! 


## Intro
After finishing my postgraduate degree in Analytics & Data Science I decided that I should continue practicing what I had learned, because I don't want to forget what I had learned, because practice makes perfect and because I like it! :-D
So I went to Kaggle and choose the **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster** Competition to start my practice (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview).
